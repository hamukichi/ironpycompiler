IronCompiler
================

IronCompiler will be useful for compiling your IronPython scripts 
requiring modules from the Python standard library (or third-party 
pure-Python modules) into .NET assembly, using pyc.py.

NOTE. It has not been long since I started to develop IronCompiler, 
so there is no stable release of this module.
