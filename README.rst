pycCompileHelper
================

pycCompileHelper will be useful for compiling your IronPython scripts 
requiring modules from the Python standard library (or third-party 
pure-Python modules) into .NET assembly, using pyc.py.

NOTE. It has not been long before I started to develop pycCompileHelper, 
so there is no stable release of this module.
